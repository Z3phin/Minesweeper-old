# Minesweeper(v.1.2) or 'Minsweeper-old-C#'

## Background

This is an old personal project I made during the time between GCSE and A-Levels, and notably during lockdown. 
Specifically, this was last modified around May, 2021.

Implemented in C# and using Visual Studio, it uses the .NET (5.0) Forms framework to provide a GUI for the game. 
Minesweeper was not the only project I made during this time, having made Chess too, several in fact, 
which all prototyped different concepts I wanted to include, such as 'picking up' and 'placing pieces'. 
However, these were never completed entirely and had several bugs. This project, on the other hand, I am
genuinely quite proud of. It's by no means great, and pretty ugly in terms of code, but the game functions 
as intended (with only a few bugs I have noticed when revisiting it). It represents the point programming
became a true passion of mine.

Since that time, I have started at Swansea University, Wales, UK, and have mostly been working in Java, 
transferring most of the skills I learned while making projects in C# such as this. 

## Key Insights, Valuable Lessons and Reflection

### Self Taught C#

During lockdown, I chose to progress my coding ability by learning C#, which is quite different to Python that I was 
taught in school. It became a challenge to learn all these new concepts, and was an invaluable experience, having trasnferred
most of what I have learned to Java and other languages since then. This project, alongside others, was a chance to 
put together all that I had learnt, and to be challenged in new ways. 

### UI and Graphics

Revisiting this project, I am quite shocked by how visually appealing the game itself is. It does not quite look exactly
the same as the original Minesweeper, nor is it actually impressive if it were a real game. But for me, as someone who
has come back to re-implement this project in Java, this looks the best ... which doesn't sound too great for my other 
projects. Nevertheless, its a notable aspect I wish to point out.

### Commenting

Clearly, from the spaghetti code, the commenting here is not the best. However, this was a crucial learning point
for commenting going forward. This project, and the others around this time, taught me the value of commenting, to clear
up any confusing aspects and to make the code generally more readable.

### IDE

I believe this project was the first experience I had with a proper IDE, being Visual Studio, learning its quirks on my own, 
and discovering the value of debugging. Despite that, I quite disitinctly remember being quite intimidated by it all at the time,
which is quite funny to think about, but was cleary a valuable experience ready for University projects in Java and IntelliJ.

### Methods

Methods are great. Fantastic stuff really, and this taught me the value of them, understanding them properly and their
best uses, that being breaking problems down. Now, methods are trivial business, nothing particularly special, but here's where I
learned their value (again, they might be quite shocking in this project but that is the point to be honest).

### Iterative Upgrades and Lessons

This and Chess (which I probably won't share because that is not particularly presentable), were a great experience for me to 
prototype ideas and then implement them into the game. Often, I would have an idea for a feature, create a little test program
to find an appropriate implementation, and then incorporate them into the actual project. Knowing about Git at that time would 
have been most useful, but lessons learned. 

However, iterative upgrades were not just the features I implemented, but also the practices and coding ability that I 
progressed and strengthened. That's why I take the attitude now of most projects I work on are, if nothing else, iteratively
upgrading my personal programming skill, and are always learning experiences. 

### Coding conventions, style and classes

Spaghetti is a great food, but not a particularly desirable code style. The source code got a bit greedy with its spaghetti, and
I rued the unreadable nature of it all at the time. Fortunately, this has something I have much improved and quite a stickler for.
Readable code is quite pretty. This isn't pretty, but I bet Picasso and the likes first paintings weren't too pretty either. Unless
they were, then this comparison doesn't particularly work, but you understand me.

Coming back to this project in Java, I have always aimed to make each version prettier than the last, in terms of code readability,
perhaps making up for this one, harnacing the value of custom classes and OOP better, which are quite lacking in this version.

## Personal Sentimental Value

If it doesn't come across in the above, I hold this project quite dearly, recognising it as the point where I understood the 
value of practice, iterative progression, and code readability. From here on, I have always said 'lets improve on last time'. 
I recognise much of the topics discussed here are quite basic, and hardly impressive, but its more about the emotional value 
for me. Truly, I believe this is where I fell in love with programming.
