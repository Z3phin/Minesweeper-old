# Minesweeper(v.1.2) or 'Minsweeper-old-C#'

This is an old personal project I made during the time between GCSE and A-Levels, and notably during lockdown. Specifically, this was last modified around May, 2021.

It uses the .NET (5.0) Forms framework, and is, in my opinion, a very visually appealing game (compared to my other, lets say, less appealing implementations), complete with most features, other than 'difficulties'.

Since this time, I have started at Swansea University, Wales, UK, and have mostly been working in Java, transferring most of the skills I learned while making projects in C# such as this.

Obviously, this is a very a early project, with a lot of spaghetti code, which is quite unreadable and ugly.
There is also not much, if any, use of custom classes, which I would personally do now (see my other Java Minesweeper project, which doesn't quite look as this one admittedly, but adheres to more coding conventions)

This project was invaluable to me learning proper method use, and commenting. Even if they are quite poor in this project, it was something I learned from going forward.

I hold this project quite dearly, which is why I probably have tried to remake it in Java several times.
Hopefully, I intend to come back to improve upon this project, making it much more readable.
